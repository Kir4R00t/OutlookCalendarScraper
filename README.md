# Outlook calendar scraper
Synchronize a Microsoft Outlook / Teams university calendar with Google Calendar using a self-hosted, Dockerized service.

This project was created to solve a real-world limitation: university Outlook calendars (published via Microsoft 365 / Teams) often cannot be directly subscribed to in Google Calendar due to permission or authentication restrictions.
